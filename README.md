1. Programs will firstly read the rows and then read the cols and last read the type. The order of pixel structure is bit_depth, then colorspaces, and then number_of_channel.


2. For the RGB outputs, the red output only keeps the value of red, so does the green and blue output. Y, Cb and Cr outputs are from YCbCr Colorspaces. And Hue, Saturation and Value outputs belong to HSV Colorspaces.
